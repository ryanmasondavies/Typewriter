Typewriter
==========

When an iOS keyboard is present, TWRTypist can be used to enter a string as follows:

    [TWRTypist typeString:@"Hello world!"];

As of 0.1.0, the following character sets are supported:
*  Uppercase and lowercase letters
*  Spaces
*  Punctuation
*  Special characters

See RMTTypistSpec for a list of the supported characters and keyboards.

Typewriter uses private APIs and should not be used in a production environment.

Installation
============

Typewriter can be installed with [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) by adding `pod 'Typewriter', '~> 0.1.0'` to your Podfile.
